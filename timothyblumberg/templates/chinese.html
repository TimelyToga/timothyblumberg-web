    <div class="container">
        <p>I started studying Chinese since Fall 2014 and since then what was originally just a
            class taken to fulfill a requirement has blossomed into a full-blown passion.
            I have invested a non-trivial percentage of my life into studying Chinese so I want
            to make sure that I position myself to make the most of that time investment.</p>
        <p>After I graduated from Duke in May 2017, I moved to China learn as much as I could
            about starting and running technology companies here.</p>
    <p>I write a weekly update email every Wednesday. If you would like to stay up to date on my meanderings,
        please sign-up for my email list. I hate spam more than you do so you'll never get anything but
    an update email from me.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>
