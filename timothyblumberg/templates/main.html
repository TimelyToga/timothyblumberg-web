                        entrepreneur that is doing my best to learn all that there is to learn in the world.

                                I recently found a demo of IBM Watson's User Modeling and decided to see if I could harness
                                this tech demo to analyze my own personality. I have kept a digital journal since 2011, so
                                I had a large amount of data available to analyze, so I extracted the text of journal entries
                                by year and submitted them to the analytical eye of Watson. I wrote a pretty detailed blog post
                                about my process and results. Most interestingly, I found that as I developed into an adult,
                                I didn't develop new characteristics really. But rather, I pruned out certain characteristics
                                and marginally advanced others. So my strongest traits became stronger and I completely deleted
                                certain other traits out of my personality all together. Overall this was one of the most informative
                                technical investigations I have ever done because it taught me a lot about myself.

                                WikiQuiz was my entry into <a href="http://www.hackduke.com/">HackDuke's</a> 2014 Education
                                category. WikiQuiz is the embodiment of a very long running project of mine to figure out
                                how to extract the most salient objective facts from a corpus of text. In this case I do so
                                by a combination of a number of methods chief of which is some basic NLP feature extraction
                                using nltk. I believe that if the process of extracting the important and objective thoughts
                                from a body of text is one of greatest challenges that technology is facing today.
                                I began development at HackDuke and have since been making modifications to better the
                                question generation.

                                Instead of cramming for a single continuous chunk of time before an exam, one could use LearnThings
                                to space that studying time out over several weeks. LearnThings uses notifications to
                                passively ask you questions, which you can directly interact with, or tap through
                                to grade yourself. LearnThings is at most two taps
                                per interaction, so the experience is left light. You can tell LearnThings when you are
                                available so that you will only get asked questions within that time frame.

                                Camoji is a content creation tool that allows you to record gifs and easily send or
                                share them with friends. Camoji relies heavily upon gestures for app navigation. Swiping
                                in each cardinal direction performs an action (Share, Delete, Back to Camera, Send). I
                                specifically worked on the web-server.

                                Fratspeak is a project that I threw together with a couple friends over a weekend that
                                uses some boring technology to generate sentences "in the style" of fratstars. For the
                                most part, these sentences entirely lack any inkling of orthology or general sentence syntax.
