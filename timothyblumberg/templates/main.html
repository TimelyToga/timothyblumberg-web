                                Instead of cramming for a large chunk of time before an exam, one could use LearnThings
                                to space things out. LearnThings uses notifications to ask you questions, which you can
                                directly interact with, or tap through to grade yourself. LearnThings is at most two taps
                                per interaction, so the experience is left light. LearnThings knows when you need to
                                have mastered your material, so it paces the testing accordingly so you are perfectly prepared.

                                Fratspeak is a project that I threw together with a couple friends over a weekend that uses some boring technology to generate sentences "in the style" of fratstars. For the most part, these sentences entirely lack any inkling of orthology or general sentence syntax.

                                I wrote this app because I abhor small talk. I hate to waste time with conversation topics in which I have very little chance of gleaning any information of worth from because they lack the complexity to imbue it. BetterConfab is meant to be a tool with which you can unlock more interesting conversation with people you don't know...yet.
